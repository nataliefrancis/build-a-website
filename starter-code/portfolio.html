		<h2>Experience</h2>

		<p>I spent the last 11 years working for an Anchorage locally owned Escrow company in which I spent a great deal of my time there hiring/training new employees, as well as organizing various manuals, supervising a department spread across three branches, and being the liason between our underwriter/software engineer and the president of our company. I am a recent graduate of General Assembly in which I studied how to be a Fullstack web developer, focusing on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
